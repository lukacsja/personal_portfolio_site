Welcome to my personal portfolio website, powered by Next.js v13! ðŸš€

[DEMO LINK](https://personal-portfolio-site-gamma.vercel.app/)

ðŸŽ¨ The design inspiration for this project came from [this Figma](<https://www.figma.com/file/1eXWgJOB2W62ycQU1C1pq7/Portfolio-for-Developers-Concept-V.2-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=s3VmY432f8IXKpyJ-0>) concept with some minor modifications. I want to extend my gratitude to [darelove_designs](https://www.instagram.com/darelova_designs/) for her fantastic design work.

Please note that this portfolio site is currently in development, and I'm actively working on adding more content and features. Stay tuned for updates!
